Project Title: HyperNotes
Description:
Develop HyperNotes, a sleek, modern, and minimalist to-do list app focused on simplicity and efficiency. The app will function entirely offline without any login credentials. It will support dark mode with polished animations for an enhanced user experience.

Core Features:
üóÇ Home Screen:
A "Create" button to add new pages.
On tapping, prompt the user to enter a name for the page.
After creation, the page should appear on the dashboard as a preview card.
Search Bar: To quickly search for pages or tasks.
Bin/Trash Icon: To access deleted pages (Bin) and deleted tasks (Trash).
Pull-to-Refresh: Refresh the list of pages with a simple pull-down gesture.
üìÑ Page Management:
Add Page: Create pages with customizable names.
Page Preview: Display created pages on the home screen dashboard with a clean layout.
Double-Tap to Edit Page Name: Users can double-tap on the page title to quickly rename it.
Page Settings: Accessed via a 3-dot icon on each page, providing options to:
Rename Page
Delete Page (with confirmation dialog)
Delete Page:
Pages aren't permanently deleted; they go to the "Bin" section on the home screen.
Page Display Preferences:
Allow users to choose how pages are displayed (e.g., 2 or 3 pages per row).
‚úÖ Task Management:
Add Task: Each page has an option to add tasks.
Task Notes:
Each task can have detailed notes.
Notes are hidden by default but can be expanded with an arrow icon.
Mark as Complete/Incomplete:
Confirmation prompts before changing task status.

Tasks go to a dedicated "Trash" page instead of being permanently deleted.
Option to restore or permanently delete from Trash.
üåô Dark Mode:
Support for dark mode with smooth, polished animations for transitions.

Accessibility:
Adjustable font sizes
High-contrast mode options
Responsive Design: Optimized for various screen sizes and resolutions.
Confirmation Dialogs: Before critical actions (delete, mark complete, etc.) to prevent accidental changes.
Animations:
Smooth transitions between screens
Animated page/task interactions for better UX
